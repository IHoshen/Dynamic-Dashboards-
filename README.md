# Dynamic-Dashboards

Hi, everyone !
Following the data analysis course in Excel I did through the udemy website,
I created Dynamic Dashboards based on movie data from the IMDb site.
By creating Dynamic Dashboards that connect the tables, graphs and filters (by columns and time) you can easily see all the data you filtered at the same time easily and quickly.
I learned a lot from this course!
Until today I was sure that it was best to work only with Python to perform data analysis. Following the course I learned how to do data analysis with Excel as easy and visual as Python!
